*PyMine - The fastest, easiest to use, Python-based Minecraft Server!* 

<br>

## Installation / Usage
* For now, PyMine will not be packaged as a binary, you'll have to install everything yourself.
### Installing from source
* First, clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/py-mine/PyMine.git` and move into that directory (`cd PyMine`)
* Next, install the required Python packages via pip (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* To run the server, you should run `server.py` from the root directory, like `python3 src/server.py`
* It is recommended you do not use regular Python, but [PyPy3](https://www.pypy.org/)
